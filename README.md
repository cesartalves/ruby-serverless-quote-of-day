This is a simple API that consumes a Quote Of Day API (https://quotes.rest/qod.json) and shows the quote and author using AWS Lambda and Serverless

Credits for the quotes api go to They Said So

Uses gitlab-ci CI/CD.
I also created a step do analyse the code on sonarqube

## Steps:

Setup AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
